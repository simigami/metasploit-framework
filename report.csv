192.168.77.132,21.0,tcp,6.4,Anonymous FTP Login Reporting,Reports if the remote FTP Server allows anonymous logins.,"It was possible to login to the remote FTP service with the following anonymous account(s):

anonymous:anonymous@example.com
ftp:anonymous@example.com

",CVE-1999-0497,"A host that provides an FTP service may additionally provide
  Anonymous FTP access as well. Under this arrangement, users do not strictly need an account on the
  host. Instead the user typically enters 'anonymous' or 'ftp' when prompted for username. Although
  users are commonly asked to send their email address as their password, little to no verification
  is actually performed on the supplied data.

  Remark: NIST don't see 'configuration issues' as software flaws so the referenced CVE has a
  severity of 0.0. The severity of this VT has been raised by Greenbone to still report a
  configuration issue on the target."

          <p>As you may have guessed by now, this is the default Tomcat home page. It can be found on the local filesystem at:</p>
          <p class=""code"">$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/index.jsp</p>
	  
          <p>where ""$CATALINA_HOME"" is the root of the Tomcat installation directory. If you're seeing this page, and you don't think you should be, then either you're either a user who has arrived at new installation of Tomcat, or you're an administrator who hasn't got his/her setup quite right. Providing the latter is the case, please refer to the <a href=""tomcat-docs"">Tomcat Documentation</a> for more detailed setup and administration information than is found in the INSTALL file.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE:</b> This page is precompiled. If you change it, this page will not change since
                  it was compiled into a servlet at build time.
                  (See <tt>$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml</tt> as to how it was mapped.)
            </p>

            <p><b>NOTE: For security reasons, using the administration webapp
            is restricted to users with role ""admin"". The manager webapp
